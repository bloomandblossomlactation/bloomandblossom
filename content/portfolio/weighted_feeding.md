Sometimes when baby has slow weight gain and low milk supply is suspect, has oral ties, or is unable to maintain latch for long periods of time, or even if mommy just needs reassurance, a weighted feeding can help.

A Weighted Feeding consultation normally lasts 45-60 minutes and are performed in-home. An IBCLC certified lactation consultant will bring a hospital-grade portable baby scale to your home where they will conduct a weighted feeding to determine the amount of milk baby is receiving. Following the feeding, the lactation consultant will assess the feeding against healthcare guidelines and discuss progress with mother as well as their personalized care plan.
