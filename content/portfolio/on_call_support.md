Families may sign up for an on-call subscription providing up to three hours of on-call and texting support over a three-month period. Many mothers want the peace of mind to know that, should they encounter any breastfeeding challenge, a licensed lactation consultant is available to answer their questions. If calls are missed, they will be returned within 24 hours. For new and experienced mothers alike, on-call support from an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant, is the peace of mind needed to ease your concerns.
