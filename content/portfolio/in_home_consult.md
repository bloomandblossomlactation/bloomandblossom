In-home lactation consultations normally range from 30 to 90 minutes.  During the consultation, an IBCLC certified lactation consultant will assess both baby and mother's abilities to nurse.  The lactation consultant will then provide tailored education on breast feeding, answer any questions mother may have about challenges and alternatives associated with feeding.  Finally, the lactation consultant will provide a feeding plan tailored to mother's needs, and addressing any issues identified during the consultation.
