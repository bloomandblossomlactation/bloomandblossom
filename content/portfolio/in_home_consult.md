In-home lactation consultations normally range from 60 to 90 minutes. During the consultation a full nursing session will be observed.  The baby will be assessed for oral function and for latching abilities and/or difficulties.  The consultant will discuss latch issues, sore nipples, and assess mother’s breast for any trauma. Once difficulties and needs are established, the lactation consultant will provide personalized education on breast feeding and answer any questions mother may have about challenges and alternatives associated with feeding. Finally, the lactation consultant will provide a feeding plan tailored to mother’s needs and address any issues identified during the consultation.
