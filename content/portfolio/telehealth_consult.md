Tele-health consultations normally range from 30 to 60 minutes. During the consultation, an IBCLC certified lactation consultant will participate in a private video call with mother and baby. The lactation consultant will observe mother feeding, identify any potential issues, answer questions related to feeding, and identify a personalized care plan to address mother and babyâ€™s needs.
