            "While Tabitha certainly helped me and my baby get to a point where we were successful with nursing, the biggest thing she did for me was to provide some much needed support and reassurance. The first months after giving birth were exhausting, and nursing challenges created an extra level of anxiety. I am so grateful to Tabitha for her support during such a difficult time."
